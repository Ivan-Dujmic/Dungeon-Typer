## Development of a Keyboard Typing Practice Game with Roguelike Elements
### Task
Fast and accurate typing on a keyboard is becoming increasingly important in the digital age, and interactive games can contribute to motivating users to learn and improve this skill. As part of the bachelor thesis, it is necessary to develop a computer game that combines typing practice with elements of the roguelike genre, such as randomly generated challenges, progressive upgrades, and progress reset upon failure. It is necessary to research and describe existing applications and games meant for learning typing and analyze their approaches and mechanics. Then, the game concept must be definedâ€”what the challenges will look like, how the random elements will be generated, and which upgrades will be available to players. Based on the defined concept, a game system needs to be developed that includes text input as the main form of interaction with the game and implements roguelike elements such as randomly generated challenges, permadeath (permanent death that resets progress upon failure), and gradual player development through upgrade selection during the game. When implementing, attention should be paid to maintaining a balance between the educational and entertainment aspects.
