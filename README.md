## Development of a Keyboard Typing Practice Game with Roguelike Elements
### Task
Fast and accurate typing is becoming increasingly important in the digital age, and interactive games can enhance user motivation to learn and improve this skill. As part of the final thesis, a computer game should be developed that combines typing practice with elements of the roguelike genre, such as randomly generated challenges, progressive upgrades, and progress reset upon failure. It is necessary to research and describe existing applications and games for learning to type, and to analyze their approaches and mechanics. Next, the concept of the game should be defined - what the challenges will look like, how the random elements will be generated, and which upgrades will be available to players. Based on the defined game concept, a game system must be developed that includes text input as the primary method of interaction, and implements roguelike elements such as randomly generated challenges, permadeath (resetting progress upon failure), and gradual player development through upgrade selection during gameplay. The implementation should carefully balance the educational and entertainment aspects of the game.
